## Contributing

The translations for **Japanese** and **Simplified Chinese** need to be refined, and I am also planning to add the **Korean** translation but I don't understand Korean.

If you are familiar with these languages, you can help improve the translation by [opening an issue](https://github.com/zetaraku/arcade-songs/issues) or [creating a pull request](https://github.com/zetaraku/arcade-songs/pulls). The translation files are located in `locales/`.

If you have any ideas or suggestions, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/zetaraku/arcade-songs/issues) or [use the ask form](https://arcade-songs-report.zetaraku.dev/). Improvement to the code is welcome.
