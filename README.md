A utility site that provides a searching interface for arcade games songs and sheets.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Setup

```sh
# install dependencies
yarn install
```

- Make a copy of the `.env.example` file as `.env` and fill out the required fields.

## Development

```sh
# serve with hot reload at localhost
yarn run dev

# serve with hot reload on local network
yarn run dev:host
```

- For a detailed explanation of each directory, check out the [Nuxt documentation](https://nuxtjs.org).

## Build for production

### Static hosting with SSG (recommended)

```sh
# Build the application (if needed), generate every route as a HTML file and statically export to dist/ directory (used for static hosting).
yarn run generate

# serve the dist/ directory like your static hosting would do (Netlify, Vercel, Surge, etc), great for testing before deploying.
yarn run serve
```

### Server hosting with SSR

```sh
# Build and optimize your application with webpack for production.
yarn run build

# Start the production server (after running nuxt build). Use it for Node.js hosting like Heroku, Digital Ocean, etc.
yarn run start
```

## Contributing

The translations for **Japanese** and **Simplified Chinese** need to be refined, and I am also planning to add the **Korean** translation but I don't understand Korean.

If you are familiar with these languages, you can help improve the translation by [opening an issue](https://github.com/zetaraku/arcade-songs/issues) or [creating a pull request](https://github.com/zetaraku/arcade-songs/pulls). The translation files are located in `locales/`.

If you have any ideas or suggestions, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/zetaraku/arcade-songs/issues) or [use the ask form](https://arcade-songs-report.zetaraku.dev/). Improvement to the code is welcome.
